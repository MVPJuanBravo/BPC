# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you quickly get started with the Business Process Catalog template.

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [ ] Azure DevOps organization with admin access
- [ ] Process Migrator tool downloaded and extracted
- [ ] .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher installed
- [ ] This BPC repository downloaded or cloned

## 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Download Process Migrator

```bash
# Download from: https://github.com/microsoft/process-migrator/releases
# Extract to a folder, e.g., C:\Tools\ProcessMigrator
```

### 2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell

Navigate to the Process Migrator directory:

```bash
cd C:\Tools\ProcessMigrator
```

### 3. Authenticate with Azure DevOps

The tool will prompt for credentials when you run it. Make sure you have:
- Your Azure DevOps organization URL: `https://dev.azure.com/YourOrganization`
- Appropriate permissions (Project Collection Administrator)

### 4. Import the Template

**Note**: The current configuration.json is a reference template. For actual import with Process Migrator, you'll need to export a base process first and then customize it.

#### Option A: Create Custom Process via UI (Recommended for Beginners)

1. Go to `https://dev.azure.com/YourOrganization/_settings/process`
2. Click "Create inherited process"
3. Select "Agile" as the parent process
4. Name it "Business Process Catalog"
5. Customize using the configuration.json as a guide

#### Option B: Use Process Migrator (Advanced)

First, export an existing process to get the correct format:

```bash
process-migrator.exe export -n "Agile" -a "https://dev.azure.com/YourOrg"
```

This will create a folder with the process template. You can then modify it based on the configuration.json provided in this repository.

### 5. Create Your First Project

1. Go to Azure DevOps
2. Click "New Project"
3. Name your project (e.g., "Process Management")
4. Under "Advanced" â†’ "Work item process", select "Business Process Catalog"
5. Click "Create"

### 6. Start Documenting Processes

1. Go to Boards â†’ Work Items
2. Click "New Work Item"
3. Select "Business Process" from the dropdown
4. Fill in the details:
   - Title: Name of your process
