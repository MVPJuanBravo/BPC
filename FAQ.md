## Installation Questions

### Do I need special permissions to import the template?

Yes, you need to be a member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group in your Azure DevOps organization.

### Can I use this template on Azure DevOps Server (on-premises)?

Yes, the Process Migrator tool supports both Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server 2019+.

### What if I don't have .NET Framework 4.7.2?

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework

### Can I import this template multiple times?

## Customization Questions

### Can I modify the template after importing?

Yes! You can customize the template through:
1. Azure DevOps UI (Organization Settings â†’ Process)
2. Export, modify, and re-import using Process Migrator

### Can I add my own custom fields?

Absolutely. You can add as many custom fields as needed through the Process customization interface or by modifying the exported JSON files.

### Can I remove work item types I don't need?

You cannot delete work item types, but you can:

- Simply not use them

### Will customizations affect existing projects?

No. Changes to the process template only affect new projects or projects you explicitly update to use the new version.

## Usage Questions

### How do I create a hierarchy of processes?

Use the parent-child linking feature:
1. Create a main "Business Process" work item
2. Create "Process Step" work items
3. Link the steps as children of the main process

### Can I track process versions?

Yes, several approaches:
1. Use the built-in "History" tab on work items
2. Add a custom "Version" field
3. Clone processes and mark old versions as "Deprecated"

### How do I set up process review reminders?

1. Add "Next Review Date" field to your processes
2. Create a query to find processes due for review
3. Set up alerts on the query
4. Use Azure DevOps automation rules to send notifications

### Can I integrate with other systems?

Yes, through:
- Azure DevOps REST API
- Power Automate connectors
- Custom integrations using the API

## Process Migrator Questions

### What does Process Migrator actually do?

Process Migrator is a command-line tool that:
- Exports process templates from Azure DevOps
- Imports process templates to Azure DevOps
- Allows offline editing of process definitions

### Where can I get help with Process Migrator?

- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/microsoft/process-migrator
- Wiki: https://github.com/microsoft/process-migrator/wiki
- Issues: https://github.com/microsoft/process-migrator/issues

### Can I use Process Migrator for migration between organizations?

Yes, that's one of its primary use cases. Export from one organization and import to another.

### Does Process Migrator migrate work items?

No. Process Migrator only handles process template definitions. For work item migration, use:
- Azure DevOps migration tools
- Excel import/export
- Third-party migration tools

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Why can't I see my custom process in the project creation dropdown?

Possible causes:
1. Process import failed (check for error messages)
2. You're not looking in the "Advanced" section during project creation
3. Process is disabled
4. Browser cache issues (try refreshing)

### Why am I getting authentication errors with Process Migrator?

Solutions:
1. Ensure you have the correct organization URL
2. Check you have proper permissions
3. Try generating a Personal Access Token (PAT) with full access
4. Verify your PAT hasn't expired

### Can I undo a process import?

You can:
- Create a new process with your old settings
- Switch projects to use a different process
- You cannot delete a process being used by projects

### What if the configuration.json doesn't import correctly?

The configuration.json in this repository is a **reference template**, not a direct import file. To use Process Migrator:
1. Export an existing process first
2. Use that export's structure
3. Modify it based on the configuration.json
4. Re-import the modified export

## Best Practices Questions

### How many processes should I document?

Start small:
- Phase 1: 5-10 critical processes
- Phase 2: 20-30 important processes
- Phase 3: Expand based on value delivered

### How often should I review processes?

Recommended frequencies:
- Critical processes: Quarterly
- Important processes: Semi-annually
- Standard processes: Annually

### Should I document every detail?

No. Focus on:
- Key steps and decision points
- Critical dependencies
- Compliance requirements
- Common issues and resolutions

### How do I get team adoption?

1. Start with a pilot team
2. Show quick wins
3. Make it easy to use
4. Integrate with existing workflows
5. Provide training and support
6. Celebrate successes

## Technical Questions
